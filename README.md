![David.png](samples%2FDavid.png), ![Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring.jpg](samples%2FGirl_with_a_Pearl_Earring.jpg),
![Painting_by_Henri_Biva.jpg](samples%2FPainting_by_Henri_Biva.jpg) are faithful reproductions of public-domain works of
art; they were all obtained from Wikipedia.

![Mona_Lisa.jpg](samples%2FMona_Lisa.jpg) is a remastered version of the public-domain Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci.
[Its source is on Wikimedia Commons, here](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mona_Lisa_Digitally_Restored.tif) .

![Frog.jpg](samples%2FFrog.jpg) is a public-domain image of a red-eyed tree frog,
[taken by Carey James Balboa](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Red_eyed_tree_frog_edit2.jpg) .

![cc.png](samples%2Fcc.png) is a screenshot of the video game Chrono Cross, originally used in
[Joel Yliluoma's dithering article](https://bisqwit.iki.fi/story/howto/dither/jy/).

![gradients.png](samples%2Fgradients.png) was also used in the article linked above.

![Portal_Companion_Cube.jpg](samples%2FPortal_Companion_Cube.jpg) was also used as an example in a dithering article,
but I can't remember where it was. I think it was about error-diffusion dither...

![Koh-i-Noor.jpg](samples%2FKoh-i-Noor.jpg) is from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Replica_of_the_Koh-i-Noor_(cropped).jpg .

![Color_Guard.png](samples%2FColor_Guard.png) is a snippet of a texture atlas made from some [wargame pixel art I previously released into the public domain](https://opengameart.org/content/pixvoxel-revised-isometric-wargame-sprites).
![Cat_Portrait.png](samples%2FCat_Portrait.png), ![Cat_Posing.jpg](samples%2FCat_Posing.jpg), ![Happy_Dog.jpg](samples%2FHappy_Dog.jpg),
![Pounce.png](samples%2FPounce.png), and ![Trance.png](samples%2FTrance.png) are all pictures I took of my pets. They
can be considered public domain.

![Judgment_Cat.jpg](samples%2FJudgment_Cat.jpg), ![Kitten.jpg](samples%2FKitten.jpg), ![Purrito.jpg](samples%2FPurrito.jpg),
and ![Roar.jpg](samples%2FRoar.jpg) are all pictures Shelby Lynn took of her pets; I have permission to use them here.

![GoStones](samples/GoStones.png) and ![GoChips](samples/GoChips.png) are lossy renders of a game board by
[Loren Schmidt](https://twitter.com/lorenschmidt/status/1703462926726640124); they're used here to compare dither
algorithms with what Schmidt is working on, but I'll take them down if she requests.

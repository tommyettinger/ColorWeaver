     * A generalization on bias and gain functions that can represent both; this version is branch-less.
     * This is based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09714">this micro-paper</a> by Jon Barron, which
     * generalizes the earlier bias and gain rational functions by Schlick. The second and final page of the
     * paper has useful graphs of what the s (shape) and t (turning point) parameters do; shape should be 0
     * or greater, while turning must be between 0 and 1, inclusive. This effectively combines two different
     * curving functions so they continue into each other when x equals turning. The shape parameter will
     * cause this to imitate "smoothstep-like" splines when greater than 1 (where the values ease into their
     * starting and ending levels), or to be the inverse when less than 1 (where values start like square
     * root does, taking off very quickly, but also end like square does, landing abruptly at the ending
     * level). You should only give x values between 0 and 1, inclusive.
     * @param x progress through the spline, from 0 to 1, inclusive
     * @param shape must be greater than or equal to 0; values greater than 1 are "normal interpolations"
     * @param turning a value between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive, where the shape changes
     * @return a float between 0 and 1, inclusive

     * A way of taking a double in the (0.0, 1.0) range and mapping it to a Gaussian or normal distribution, so high
     * inputs correspond to high outputs, and similarly for the low range. This is centered on 0.0 and its standard
     * deviation seems to be 1.0 (the same as {@link Random#nextGaussian()}). If this is given an input of 0.0
     * or less, it returns -38.5, which is slightly less than the result when given {@link Double#MIN_VALUE}. If it is
     * given an input of 1.0 or more, it returns 38.5, which is significantly larger than the result when given the
     * largest double less than 1.0 (this value is further from 1.0 than {@link Double#MIN_VALUE} is from 0.0). If
     * given {@link Double#NaN}, it returns whatever {@link Math#copySign(double, double)} returns for the arguments
     * {@code 38.5, Double.NaN}, which is implementation-dependent. It uses an algorithm by Peter John Acklam, as
     * implemented by Sherali Karimov.

     * Acklam's algorithm and Karimov's implementation are both quite fast. This appears faster than generating
     * Gaussian-distributed numbers using either the Box-Muller Transform or Marsaglia's Polar Method, though it isn't
     * as precise and can't produce as extreme min and max results in the extreme cases they should appear. If given
     * a typical uniform random {@code double} that's exclusive on 1.0, it won't produce a result higher than
     * {@code 8.209536145151493}, and will only produce results of at least {@code -8.209536145151493} if 0.0 is
     * excluded from the inputs (if 0.0 is an input, the result is {@code 38.5}). A chief advantage of using this with
     * a random number generator is that it only requires one random double to obtain one Gaussian value;
     * {@link Random#nextGaussian()} generates at least two random doubles for each two Gaussian values, but may rarely
     * require much more random generation.
     * @param d should be between 0 and 1, exclusive, but other values are tolerated
